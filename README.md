# -CPU-Scheduler-Application

The CPU Scheduler Application is a desktop tool developed using Python and PyQt5 that simulates process scheduling algorithms commonly used in operating systems. The application allows users to input a set of processes along with their burst times and select from various scheduling algorithms including FCFS (First Come, First Served), SJF (Shortest Job First), and RR (Round Robin). After scheduling the processes, the application calculates and displays metrics such as waiting time, turnaround time, and average times. Additionally, it provides a visual representation of the scheduling using a Gantt chart.
